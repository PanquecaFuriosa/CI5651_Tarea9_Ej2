# Monte Carlo algorithm for matrices

# Problem:

Let $`A`$ and $`B`$ be two $`n \times n`$ matrices, for some integer $`n > 0`$.
We suspect that $`B = A−1$`. That is, $`B`$ is the inverse matrix of $`A`$.

Design a Monte Carlo algorithm that allows you to confirm this suspicion, with a certain allowed error $`ε`$, using time $`O(n^2 log^{1/ε})`$.
